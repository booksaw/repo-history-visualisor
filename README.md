# Repo-History-Visualiser

A project to produce customisable visualsiations of Git repository histories. This project was created as part of a University of York, Computer Science bachelor's degree.

## Running the program

There are several ways to run the program depending on your needs:
NOTE: Java 17 must be installed and all commands must be executed using it.

### Development mode

Within the directory "front-end" execute the command:

#### `npm start`

Then within the root folder execute the command: 

#### `mvnw spring-boot:run`

The Spring Boot server is now being hosted on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) so endpoints can be tested to that port.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the front-end in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Combined development mode

This mode builds the front-end and copies the files across to run with the back-end

Execute the following command in the root directory: 
#### `./mvnw spring-boot:run -Pprod`

This builds the front-end react app and runs the springboot applciation

You can then access the project at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
